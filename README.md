Microblog NYCDA Project 

Welcome to Groupie!
You saved every ticket from every show youâ€™ve ever seen.
You have drawers full of band tees and walls plastered with band posters.
You've crossed state lines and travel to new cities, all in the name of good live music.
You share your favorite bands in every way you can because you want the entire world to be a fan too.

Groupie is blogging space for a music fan like you!
